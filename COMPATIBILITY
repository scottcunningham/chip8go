Tested ROMs
-----------

Working:
--
Maze (alt) [David Winter, 199x]            -- OK!
ZeroPong [zeroZshadow, 2007]               -- OK! Controls seem weird though.
Random Number Test [Matthew Mikolay, 2010] -- OK!


Partially working:
--
test_opcode                         -- everything draws correctly apart from 'F3'
Trip8 Demo (2008) [Revival Studios] -- seems to freeze before the face animation
Paddles                             -- screen flickers, not sure if it responds to input
Particle Demo [zeroZshadow, 2008]   -- particles don't seem to travel around correctly, get stuck in a line
SQRT Test [Sergey Naydenov, 2010]   -- mostly works, but draws sprites in wrong places


Broken:
--
Space Invaders [David\ Winter]      -- instruction E9A1 (EXA1) instruction causes panic
